Every time I see a notification, I run towards it like a mental patient to click on it. So to not waste time clicking on them, I made this extension for Google Chrome that does this for me ðŸ™ƒ

The cool thing is that I can keep getting some notifications configured in my Gmail (I rarely read this shit), and I keep my YouTube browsing clean.

It hides the notification icon in the top bar of the page. And removes the notification counter from the page title.

To install this extension on your Google Chrome, you must download it, and then install it manually. If you don't know how to install an extension manually, just do a quick Google search and you'll find out soon enough.
